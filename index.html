                <h2>1. Pulp Fiction </h2>
                <p>From my favorite director, the storytelling in this film is what makes it unique. Many would agree it's an all-time classic. The cast's performances, soundtrack, and screenplay are why this is my number-one movie â€” a must-watch for me.</p>

                <h2>2. A Star is Born </h2>
                <p>Originally produced in 1937, this is the 3rd remake, beautifully adapted to our era by co-star Bradley Cooper in his debut as a director. If you love musicals with natural transitions to songs, where singing fits the moment, you'll not only enjoy the film but also get to hear an award-winning soundtrack co-written by the multitalented Lady Gaga.</p>
